# Bag_Of_Words
Bag of Words NLP Project
Welcome to the Bag of Words NLP project! This Jupyter Notebook project is designed to provide a basic introduction to natural language processing using the Bag of Words technique.

Overview
The Bag of Words technique is a simple approach to text analysis that involves breaking up a text into individual words (or "tokens") and counting how many times each word appears in the text. The resulting count of each word is then used as a feature in a machine learning model, allowing the model to make predictions based on the presence or absence of particular words in the input text.

In this project, we'll be using the Bag of Words technique to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the text of the review. We'll use the IMDb movie review dataset to train a machine learning model, and then evaluate the model's performance on a set of test data.

Setup
Before getting started, you'll need to make sure you have all the necessary packages installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
Once you've installed the necessary packages, you can open up the bag_of_words.ipynb notebook and run each cell in turn to see how the Bag of Words technique works in practice.

Contents
The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the Bag of Words technique:

Loading the data: In this section, we'll load the movie review dataset and take a look at what it contains.

Cleaning the data: In order to use the Bag of Words technique, we need to clean up the text of the movie reviews by removing any unwanted characters and transforming the text to a uniform format.

Tokenization: Next, we'll break up the text of each review into individual words or tokens, which will allow us to count how many times each word appears in the text.

Creating the Bag of Words: Using the tokenized text, we'll create a Bag of Words representation for each review, which will count how many times each word appears in the text.

Training the model: With our Bag of Words representation in hand, we'll train a simple machine learning model to predict whether each review is positive or negative.

Evaluating the model: Finally, we'll evaluate the performance of our machine learning model on a set of test data, and see how well it can predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

Conclusion
By the end of this project, you should have a basic understanding of how the Bag of Words technique can be used for natural language processing, and how it can be applied to a real-world problem like sentiment analysis.
